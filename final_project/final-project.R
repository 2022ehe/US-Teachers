           not been as much focus on how the social status of teachers may 
           play a role in students outcomes.   
           The Global Teacher Status Index in 2013 was the first international 
           in-depth survey that collected data from 21 countries on details such 
           as how students respect their teachers, where teachers rank among other 
           professions, how high of a salary teachers deserve, etc. The 2018 
           study analysis released even more information on 35 nations, and 
           concluded that both high teacher pay and high status are necessary 
           to produce top academic outcomes."),
