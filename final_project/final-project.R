           play a role in students outcomes.   
           The Global Teacher Status Index in 2013 was the first international 
           in-depth survey that collected data from 21 countries on details such 
           as how students respect their teachers, where teachers rank among other 
           professions, how high of a salary teachers deserve, etc. The 2018 
           study analysis released even more information on 35 nations, and 
           concluded that both high teacher pay and high status are necessary
